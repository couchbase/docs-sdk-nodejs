== Sample App Backend

The backend code shows Couchbase {name-sdk} in action with Query and Search,
but also how to plug together all of the elements and build an application with Couchbase Server and the {name-sdk}.

Here's the airport search code, which checks to see whether the search term for the query string is a three or four letter FAA or ICAO abbreviation, and if not searches for it as an airport name:

[source,javascript]
----
var qs;
  if (searchTerm.length === 3) {
    // FAA code
    qs = `SELECT airportname from \`travel-sample\` WHERE faa = '${searchTerm.toUpperCase()}';`;
  } else if (searchTerm.length === 4 &&
      (searchTerm.toUpperCase() === searchTerm ||
        searchTerm.toLowerCase() === searchTerm)) {
    // ICAO code
    qs = `SELECT airportname from \`travel-sample\` WHERE icao = '${searchTerm.toUpperCase()}';`;
  } else {
    // Airport name
    qs = `SELECT airportname from \`travel-sample\` WHERE LOWER(airportname) LIKE '%${searchTerm.toLowerCase()}%';`;
  }

  let result, rows;
  try {
    result = await cluster.query(qs);
    rows = result.rows;
  } catch (error) {
    console.error(error)
  };

  res.send({
    data: rows,
    context: [qs]
  });
