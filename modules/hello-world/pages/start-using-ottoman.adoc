{description}

Ottoman is an open-source Object Document Mapper(ODM) library, built for Node.js and Couchbase, that aspires to give developers an even better experience when building modern applications.

Ottoman ODM adds an abstraction layer over Couchbase Node.js SDK and significantly reduces the level of boilerplate needed during application development. 
It provides features such as the ability to define document schemas and perform validations on your data in a NoSQL landscape -- 
which is inherently schema-less or schema-flexible by nature. 

NOTE: Whether you are building your application with JavaScript or TypeScript, Ottoman will work seamlessly with either.

Ottoman fully supports the xref:{version-server}@server:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections] features introduced in Couchbase Sever 7.0. 
We recomend familiarizing yourself with these concepts before proceeding with this guide.

== Creating a New Ottoman Project

Creating a new Ottoman project is as easy as making a directory and initializing it with npm. 
The next two commands will do that for us. 
Open up a terminal and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir node-ottoman-project && cd $_
----

The command above will create our directory and change the current working directory.

[source,console]
----
$ npm init -y
----

If a directory does not already have a `package.json` at its root, this means it is not initialized. 
The command above will accomplish this.

Note: We have used the `-y` flag to take the initialization defaults. 
To change any of these defaults, just open the `package.json` and manually make any changes.

[source,json,indent=0]
----
{
  "name": "node-ottoman-project",
  "version": "1.0.0",
  "description": "",
  "main": "index.js",
  "scripts": {
    "test": "echo \"Error: no test specified\" && exit 1"
  },
  "keywords": [],
  "author": "",
  "license": "ISC"
}
----

== Compatibility 

Before installing Ottoman, you will need to ensure that you meet the minimum requirements shown in the compatibility table below:

[cols="8,8,8,8", options="header"]
|===
| Ottoman | Node.js | Couchbase SDK | Couchbase Server
| *^2.0.0*
| *^8.0.0*
| *^3.2.2*
| *^6.5.0*
|===

WARNING: Node.js SDK 4.x is currently not supported by the Ottoman ODM.
We intend to support version 4.x of the Node.js SDK in a future Ottoman release.

== Installing the Ottoman ODM

[source,console]
----
$ npm install ottoman --save
----

This will download the latest Ottoman ODM, and add a dependency to your `package.json`.

== Hello Ottoman

In the directory we have just created, named `node-ottoman-project`, let's create an empty file named `index.js`.
At this point we want to transition from the terminal to your code editor of choice.
We will walk through, step by step, adding code to enable us to connect to a bucket, add a document, and retrieve it.
First, import Ottoman in your new `index.js` file:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tag=import]
----

For the purposes of this example we will create an async function called `main` under our imports. 
This will contain all our example code going forward.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
async function main() {
  // your code goes here...
}
----

Now, let's create a connection to our Couchbase Server.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tag=connect]
----

Note that you can also use the below shorthand when creating a connection:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tag=alt-connect]
----

Couchbase uses xref:{version-server}@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
Here we will use the _Full Admin_ role created during installation of the Couchbase Data Platform.
For production client code, you will want to use more appropriate, restrictive settings -- but here we want to get you up and running quickly.

Since we are running this locally, we will use the Couchbase alias for localhost.

NOTE: If you are not working with the `travel-sample` data bucket, substitute _travel-sample_ with your bucket name.

=== Schemas, Models, and Documents

Everything in Ottoman starts with a _Schema_. 
A Schema maps to a Collection and defines the shape of the documents within that Collection.

_Models_ in Ottoman are simply constructors compiled from Schema definitions, which help you to easily create, read, update, and delete documents in your Couchbase database. 
An instance of a model is called a _Document_.

First, we'll define a schema to represent the shape of our data:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tag=schema]
----

Now, we call the `model()` constructor to build the model based on the schema we just created.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tag=model]
----

Notice that the constructor takes arguments like the collection `name`, `schema`, and `model options`. 
In the model options we can define properties such as `scopeName` to tell Ottoman which Scope we want to store our data in. 
In this case we are storing our data in the `inventory` Scope.

Before performing any database actions we must call the `start()` function. 
This will ensure that the relevant scopes, collections, and indexes have been created in Couchbase.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tags=start]
----

To persist the data in Couchbase we will need to create a _Document_  object and subsequently call the `save()` function:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tags=save]
----

Alternatively, we can also use the `create()` function to create and save the document:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tag=alt-save]
----

=== Querying Documents 

Querying documents is easy with Ottoman, thanks to the underlying _Query Builder_ built into the ODM. 
The Query Builder can handle many complex operations supported by Couchbase and xref:{version-server}@server:learn:data/n1ql-versus-sql.adoc[N1QL].

Documents can be retrieved using `model` helper methods such as `find()`, `findById()`, or `findOne()`. 
For this example, let's retrieve one of the airline documents we saved previously with `find()`, and filter by `callsign`:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tags=find]
----

Finally, add this last code snippet after the `main` function:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/start-using-ottoman.js[tags=run-main]
----

Now we can run our code using the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ node index.js
----

The results you should expect are as follows:

[source,console]
----
Success: airline Couchbase Airways 1 added!

Query Result:  [
  _Model {
    callsign: 'CBS',
    iata: 'CBIATA',
    icao: 'CBICAO',
    id: 'airline_8091',
    name: 'Couchbase Airways 1',
    type: 'airline'
  }
]
----
