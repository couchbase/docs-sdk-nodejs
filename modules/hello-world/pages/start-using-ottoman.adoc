{description}

Ottoman is an open-source Object Document Mapper(ODM) library, built for Node.js and Couchbase, that aspires to give developers an even better experience when building modern applications.

Ottoman ODM adds an abstraction layer over Couchbase Node.js SDK and significantly reduces the level of boilerplate needed during application development. 
It provides features such as the ability to define document schemas and perform validations on your data in a NoSQL landscape -- 
which is inherently schema-less or schema-flexible by nature. 

NOTE: Whether you are building your application with JavaScript or TypeScript, Ottoman will work seamlessly with either.

Ottoman fully supports the xref:{version-server}@server:learn:data/scopes-and-collections.adoc[Scopes and Collections] features introduced in Couchbase Sever 7.0. 
We recomend familiarizing yourself with these concepts before proceeding with this guide.

For a full feature comparison between Ottoman ODM and the Couchbase Node.js SDK you can read more https://ottomanjs.com/guides/sdk-comparison.html#ottoman-vs-sdk-comparison[here^].


== Node.js SDK 4.x Support

Ottoman currently *does not* support Node.js SDK 4.x.
We intend to fully support it in a future Ottoman release.

In the meantime, please read the xref:3.2@nodejs-sdk:hello-world:start-using-ottoman.adoc[Ottoman for Node.js SDK 3.2] page, or explore the resources below.
