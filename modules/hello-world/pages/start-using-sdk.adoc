[abstract]
The Couchbase Node.js SDK enables you to interact with a Couchbase Server cluster from the link:https://nodejs.org/[Node.js language].

The Couchbase Node.js SDK 3._x_ is a complete rewrite of the API, reducing the number of overloads to present a simplified surface area, and adding support for future Couchbase Server features like Collections and Scopes (available in Couchbase Server 6.5 as xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[a developer preview]).

The 3.0 SDK also brings in link:https://developer.mozilla.org/en-US/docs/Web/JavaScript/Guide/Using_promises[promises], to reduce the complexity of asynchronous javascript in client applications, as well as extending the management APIs and bringing better debugging and logging options

== Creating a New Node.js Project
// This section is optional

Creating a Node.js project is as easy as making a directory and initializing it with npm. The next two commands will do that for us. Open up a terminal and run the following command:

[source,console]
----
$ mkdir node-couchbase-project && cd $_
----

The command above will make our directory and change our current working directory.

[source,console]
----
$ npm init -y
----

If a directory does not already have a `package.json` at its root, this means it is not initialized. The command above will accomplish this. 

Note: We have used the `-y` flag to take the initialization defaults. To change any of these defaults, just open the `package.json` and manually make any changes.

----

----

== Installing the SDK

The Couchbase Node.js Client will run on any https://nodejs.org/en/download/[supported LTS version of Node.js].

[source,console]
----
$ npm install couchbase --save
----

Note: This will download the latest Couchbase Node.js SDK, and add a dependency to your `package.json`.

// end::install[]

Information on new features, fixes, known issues, as well as information on how to install older release versions is in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[release notes].

== Hello Couchbase

At this point we want to transition from the terminal to your code editor of choice and point to the directory we have just created named `node-couchbase-project`.

Let's now create an empty file named `index.js` and walk through step by step adding code to enable us to connect to a bucket, add a document and retrieve it using a key-value get operation:


[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=connect]
----

If you are connecting to Couchbase Cloud rather than a local Couchbase Server, see the <<cloud-connections, Cloud section>>, below.

Couchbase uses xref:6.5@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources. 
For the sake of this example, we are connecting to Couchbase using the _Full Admin_ role created during the installation of our Couchbase Server. 
Since we are running this locally, we are using the Couchbase alias for localhost.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=bucket]
----

If you are not working with the `travel-sample` data bucket, substitute _travel-sample_ with your _bucket-name_.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=default-collection]
----

The latest Couchbase Server release (6.5), brings a limited _Developer Preview_ of Collections, allowing Documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to a specified _Collection_. 
For our "Hello Couchbase" example we will simply use `DefaultCollection`, rather than a specific collection, which includes all documents in a bucket, and is forwards and backwards compatible with all supported versions of Couchbase Server.
Once the _Collections_ feature is generally available, the best practice will be to group documents into collections by type.

Let's create a document in our application that we can add to our `travel-sample` bucket that conforms to the structure of a document of type `airline`.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=test-doc]
----

Now we will create a function that will take care of upserting that document. This function is of type `async` and simply awaits the result of the upsert and either logs out the result or error in our console:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=upsert-func]
----

Now, we can simply call the `upsertDocument` function passing in our `airline` document:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=upsert-invoke]
----

We can turn around and retrieve that document using a key-value operation. Let's create a function that takes a document key that is of type `async` and awaits the result of the get operation and either logs out the result or error in our console:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=get-func]
----

KV Operations are described in detail on the xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[KV Operations page].

Now, we can simply call the `getAirlineByKey` function passing in our valid document key `airline_8091`:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/getting-started/index.js[tag=get-invoke]
----

Now we can run our code using the following command:

[source,bash]
----
npm rebuild && node index.js
----

The results you should expect are as follows:

[source,bash]
----
Upsert Result: 
{
  cas: CbCas { '0': <Buffer 00 00 13 13 f4 32 10 16> },
  token: CbMutationToken {
    '0': <Buffer cc 6d 45 09 c2 ce 00 00 2c 00 00 00 00 00 00 00 a9 03 00 00 00 00 00 00 74 72 61 76 65 6c 2d 73 61 6d 70 6c 65 00 00 00 50 6b bf ef fe 7f 00 00 28 2e ... 230 more bytes>
  }
}
Get Result: 
{
  cas: CbCas { '0': <Buffer 00 00 13 13 f4 32 10 16> },
  value: {
    type: 'airline',
    id: 8091,
    callsign: 'CBS',
    iata: null,
    icao: null,
    name: 'Couchbase Airways'
  }
}

== Cloud Connections

For developing on Couchbase Cloud, 
try the https://github.com/couchbase/docs-sdk-nodejs/blob/release/3.0/modules/devguide/examples/nodejs/cloud.js[Cloud-based Hello World program], 

If you are not working from the same _Availability Zone_ as your Couchbase Cloud, refer to the following:

* Notes on xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#constrained-network-environments[Constrained Network Environments], 
* xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#network-requirements[Network Requirements], 
* If you have a consumer-grade router which has problems with DNS-SRV records review our xref:howtos:troubleshooting-cloud-connections.adoc#troubleshooting-host-not-found[Troubleshooting Guide].



== Additional Resources

The API reference is generated for each release and the latest can be found http://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client/[here].

Links to each release are to be found in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[individual release notes].	

The xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc[Migrating from SDK2 to 3 page] highlights the main differences to be aware of when migrating your code.

Couchbase welcomes community contributions to the Node.js SDK.
The Node.js SDK source code is available on https://github.com/couchbase/couchnode[GitHub].

https://v2.ottomanjs.com/[Ottoman] is an ODM built for Couchbase and Node.js. 
Ottoman's goal is to provide a better development experience while using Couchbase, bringing to developers a reliable tool to build systems that are easy to design, maintain, and scale.
