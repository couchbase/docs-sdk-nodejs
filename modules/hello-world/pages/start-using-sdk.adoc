{description}

The Couchbase SDK API 3 (implemented by Node.js SDK 3._x_ and 4._x_) is a complete rewrite of the API, reducing the number of overloads to present a simplified surface area, and adding support for Couchbase Server features like xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections and Scopes] (available from Couchbase Server 7.0).

Node.js SDK 4._x_ implements the same SDK API 3 bindings, but the internals are completely rewritten -- 
using the Couchbase++ library rather than libcouchbase -- to allow upcoming new features such as transactions, and fix some long-standing bugs. 
Please note any xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc#sdk4-specifics[caveats] in the migration guide.

In this guide, you will learn:

* How to xref:connect[connect to Couchbase Capella or Couchbase Server].

* How to xref:add-and-retrieve-documents[add and retrieve Documents].

* How to xref:sql-lookup[lookup documents] with the {sqlpp_url}[{sqlpp} (formerly N1QL)] query language.

== Hello Couchbase

We will go through the code sample step by step, but for those in a hurry to see it, here it is:

[{tabs}] 
==== 
Couchbase Capella (JavaScript)::
+
--
To connect to xref:cloud::index.adoc[Couchbase Capella], be sure to get the correct endpoint as well as user, password and bucket name.

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/cloud.js[tags=**]
----
--

Couchbase Capella (TypeScript)::
+ 
-- 
To connect to xref:cloud::index.adoc[Couchbase Capella], be sure to get the correct endpoint as well as user, password and bucket name.

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$cloud.ts[tags=**]
----
--

Local Couchbase Server::
+ 
--
As well as the Node.js SDK, and a running instance of Couchbase Server, you will need to load up the Travel Sample Bucket
using either the xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Web interface]
or the xref:7.1@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-cli[command line].

[source,nodejs]
----
include::example$start-using.js[tags=**]
----
--
====

The Couchbase Capella free trial version comes with the Travel Sample Bucket, and its Query indexes, loaded and ready.

== Quick Installation

[source,console]
----
$ npm install couchbase --save
----

This will download the latest Couchbase Node.js SDK, and add a dependency to your `package.json`.

Information on new features, fixes, known issues, as well as information on how to install older release versions is in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[release notes], and a fuller installation guide can be found xref:project-docs:sdk-full-installation.adoc[here].

=== TypeScript Support

If you intend to use `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript`, then also do the following:

[source,console]
----
$ npm install -g typescript ts-node
----

== Prerequisites

The following code samples assume:

[{tabs}]
====
Couchbase Capella::
+
--
* You have signed up to https://cloud.couchbase.com/sign-up[Couchbase Capella].

* You have created your own bucket, or loaded the Travel Sample dataset.
Note, the Travel Sample dataset is installed automatically by the Capella free trial.

* A user is created with permissions to access the cluster (at least Application Access permissions).
See the xref:cloud:get-started:cluster-and-data.adoc#credentials[Capella connection page] for more details.

IMPORTANT: Couchbase Capella uses xref:cloud:organizations:organization-projects-overview.adoc[Roles] to control user access to database resources.
For the purposes of this guide, you can use the *Organization Owner* role automatically assigned to your account during installation of the Capella cluster.
In a production scenario, we strongly recommend setting up users with more granular access roles as a best practice.
--

Local Couchbase Server::
+
--
* xref:{version-server}@server:getting-started/do-a-quick-install.adoc[Couchbase Server] is installed and accessible locally.

* You have created your own bucket, or loaded the Travel Sample dataset using the xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc#install-sample-buckets-with-the-ui[Web interface].

* A user is created with permissions to access your cluster (at least Application Access permissions).
See xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users, Groups and Roles] for more details.

IMPORTANT: Couchbase Server uses xref:{version-server}@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Role Based Access Control (RBAC)] to control access to resources.
In this guide we suggest using the *Full Admin* role created during setup of your local Couchbase Server cluster.
For production client code, you will want to use more appropriate, restrictive settings.

== Step by Step

Create an empty file named `index.js`, or alternatively `index.ts` for TypeScript, and walk through step by step.

Here are all the imports that you will need to run the sample code.

[{tabs}]
====
JavaScript::
+ 
-- 
[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/cloud.js[tag=imports,indent=0]
----
--

TypeScript::
+ 
--
[source,typescript]
----
include::example$cloud.ts[tag=ts-imports,indent=0]
----
--
====

Now, create an empty `main()` function.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
async function main() {
  // add code here...
}
----

We will update this function as we go along the steps in this guide.

=== Connect

Connect to your cluster by calling the `connect()` function and pass it your connection details.
The basic connection details that you’ll need are given below -- for more background information, see xref:howtos:managing-connections.adoc[].

[{tabs}]
====
Couchbase Capella (JavaScript)::
+ 
-- 
From version 4.1, the Node.js SDK includes Capella’s standard certificates by default, so you don't need any additional configuration.
You do need to enable TLS, which can be done by simply using `couchbases://` in the connection string as in this example.

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/cloud.js[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

When accessing Capella from a different Wide Area Network or Availability Zone, you may experience latency issues with the default connection settings.
SDK 4.2 introduces a `wanDevelopment` Configuration Profile, which provides pre-configured timeout settings suitable for working in high latency environments.
Basic usage is shown in the example above, but if you want to learn more see xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#constrained-network-environments[Constrained Network Environments].

CAUTION: The Configuration Profiles feature is currently a xref:nodejs-sdk:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[Volatile API] and may be subject to change.

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$start-using.js[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

For developing locally on the same machine as Couchbase Server, your URI can be `couchbase://localhost` as shown here.
For production deployments, you will want to use a secure server, with `couchbases://`.

Following successful authentication, add this code snippet to access your `Bucket`:

=== Add and Retrieve Documents

The Node.js SDK supports full integration with the xref:concept-docs:collections.adoc[Collections] feature introduced in Couchbase Server 7.0.
_Collections_ allow documents to be grouped by purpose or theme, according to a specified _Scope_.

Here we refer to the `users` collection within the `tenant_agent_00` scope from the Travel Sample bucket as an example, but you may replace this with your own data.

[{tabs}]

----
--

TypeScript::
+ 
--
[source,typescript]
----
include::example$cloud.ts[tag=ts-collection,indent=0]
----
--
====

The code shows how you would use a named collection and scope.
A named or default collection will provide the same functionality as bucket-level operations did in previous versions of Couchbase Server.

NOTE: The `defaultCollection` must be used when connecting to a 6.6 cluster or earlier.

----
include::example$cloud.ts[tag=ts-default-collection,indent=0]
----
--
====

xref:howtos:kv-operations.adoc[Document operations], such as storing and retrieving documents, can be done using `Collection.upsert()` and `Collection.get()`.

Add the following code to create a new document and retrieve it:

=== {sqlpp} Lookup

Couchbase {sqlpp} queries can be performed at the `Cluster` or `Scope` level by invoking `Cluster.query()` or `Scope.query()`.

Cluster level queries require you to specify the fully qualified keyspace each time (e.g. `travel-sample.inventory.airline`).
However, with a Scope level query you only need to specify the Collection name -- which in this case is `airline`:

[{tabs}]
====
JavaScript::
+

TypeScript::

[source,typescript,indent=0]
----
include::example$cloud.ts[tag=ts-query,indent=0]

=== Execute!

To ensure that we can run the main function, we add this last line of code:

[{tabs}]
====
JavaScript::
+ 
--
[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/cloud.js[tag=run-main,indent=0]
----
--

TypeScript::
+ 
--
[source,typescript]
----
include::example$cloud.ts[tag=ts-run-main,indent=0]
----
--
====

Now we can run our code: 

[{tabs}]
====
JavaScript::
+ 
--
[source,console]
----
$ node index.js
----
--

TypeScript::
+ 
--
[source,console]
----
$ ts-node index.ts
----
--
====

The results you should expect are as follows:

[source,console]
----
Get Result: GetResult {
  content: {
    type: 'user',
    name: 'Michael',
    email: 'michael123@test.com',
    interests: [ 'Swimming', 'Rowing' ]
  },
  cas: Cas<1665739583483674624>,
  expiryTime: undefined
}
Query Results:
{ name: '40-Mile Air' }
{ name: 'Texas Wings' }
{ name: 'Atifly' }
{ name: 'Locair' }
{ name: 'SeaPort Airlines' }
{ name: 'Alaska Central Express' }
{ name: 'AirTran Airways' }
{ name: 'U.S. Air' }
{ name: 'PanAm World Airways' }
{ name: 'Bemidji Airlines' }
