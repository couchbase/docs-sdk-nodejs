[#devguide-replica-read]
== Reading from replicas

High-availability applications can read documents from replicas, exchanging consistency for availability.

If your bucket is configured for replication, then multiple replicas of each item exist within the cluster.
By default the client will attempt to access an item using its computed master or active node.
This returns the current and authoritative version of the item as it is stored within Couchbase.

In conditions where access to the active node is unavailable (for example, it is disconnected from the network), an application may be able to access a replica version of the item using the _get-from-replica_ operation which queries a replica node for a copy of the item.

NOTE: The item received from a replica node may be an older version.
It is possible a newer version exists in the active node, but did not manage to get replicated before the active node went offline.
