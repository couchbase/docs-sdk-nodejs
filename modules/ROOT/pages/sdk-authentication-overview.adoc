[abstract]
RBAC requires that users pass appropriate _credentials_ to Couchbase Server in order to access cluster-resources.
The SDK provides enhanced support for the passing of credentials.

== Passing Credentials

The most recent versions of the SDK are RBAC-enabled, and provide enhanced support for authentication.
Code examples for Node.js can be found in xref:start-using-sdk.adoc[Getting Started with the SDK], and also as part of the xref:sdk-user-management-example.adoc[Sample Code] provided to demonstrate user management.

== Upgrading to RBAC-Enabled SDK-Versions

The most recent versions of the SDK are RBAC-enabled, and provide a new, optimized authentication interface.
The last pre-RBAC version of the Node.js SDK was 2.3.2.
The first RBAC-enabled version was 2.3.3.
See the SDK link:/server/other-products/release-notes-archives/nodejs-sdk[Release Notes] for more information.

With the most recent versions of the SDK, the legacy authentication interface and the new, optimized authentication interface can both be used: each supports access to buckets on Couchbase Servers whose version is either 5.0 and beyond, or pre-5.0.

== Further Information on RBAC

All aspects of the Couchbase RBAC system are covered in the section xref:6.0@server:learn:security/authorization-overview.adoc[Authorization].
Specifically, for information on:

* Adding _Users_ and assigning _roles_, by means of the Couchbase Web Console, see xref:6.0@server:manage:manage-security/manage-users-and-roles.adoc[Manage Users and Roles].
* _Roles_ required for resource-access, and the privileges they entail, see xref:6.0@server:learn:security/roles.adoc[Roles].
* _Resources_ controlled by Couchbase RBAC, see xref:6.0@server:learn:security/resources-under-access-control.adoc[Resources Under Access Control].

== Certificate-Based Authentication

Couchbase Server supports the use of X.509 certificates to authenticate clients (only available in the Enterprise Edition, not the Community Edition).
This allows authenticated users to access specific resources by means of the data service, in Couchbase Server 5.1 and up, and all other services in more recent releases of Couchbase Data Platform.

The process relies on a certificate authority, for the issuing of certificates that validate identities.
A certificate includes information such as the name of the entity it identifies, an expiration date, the name of the authority that issued the certificate, and the digital signature of the authority.
A client attempting to access Couchbase Server can present a certificate to the server, allowing the server to check the validity of the certificate.
If the certificate is valid, the user under whose identity the client is running, and the roles assigned that user, are verified.
If the assigned roles are appropriate for the level of access requested to the specified resource, access is granted.

The Node.js SDK has supported certificate authentication since version 2.4.4.
The client certificate can be generated with the shell script on the xref:c-sdk::sdk-authentication-overview.adoc[C SDK Authentication page].
Connecting with the Node.js client, using a certificate, involves using `cluster.authenticate` and passing the certificate and key paths in the connection string.
When this authenticator is used for the `authenticate` method, it signals to the client to pick up any certificate/keystore for X509 auth:

----
// Require Couchbase Module
var couchbase = require('couchbase');

// Setup Cluster Connection Object
var cluster = new couchbase.Cluster(
    'couchbases://127.0.0.1/' +
    '?truststorepath=../etc/x509-cert/SSLCA/clientdir/trust.pem' +
    '&certpath=../etc/x509-cert/SSLCA/clientdir/client.pem' +
    '&keypath=../etc/x509-cert/SSLCA/clientdir/client.key');

// Authenticate with the cluster
cluster.authenticate(new couchbase.CertAuthenticator());

// Setup Bucket object to be reused within the code
var bucket = cluster.openBucket('travel-sample');

console.log('Example Successful - Exiting');
process.exit(0);
