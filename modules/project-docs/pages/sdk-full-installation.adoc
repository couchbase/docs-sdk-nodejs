The Couchbase Node.js Client will run on any https://github.com/nodejs/Release[supported LTS version of Node.js] -- currently, 12.x, 14.x, and 16.x.

== Installing the SDK

The Couchbase Node.js Client will run on any https://nodejs.org/en/download/[supported LTS version of Node.js].

[source,console]
----
$ npm install couchbase --save
----

Note: This will download the latest Couchbase Node.js SDK, and add a dependency to your `package.json`.


// MacOS
// https://issues.couchbase.com/browse/DOC-6367
// Catalina & node-gyp
////
npm install:

gyp: No Xcode or CLT version detected!

https://github.com/nodejs/node-gyp/blob/master/macOS_Catalina.md#Solutions
////


// end::install[]

Information on new features, fixes, known issues, as well as information on how to install older release versions is in the xref:project-docs:sdk-release-notes.adoc[release notes].

=== TypeScript Support

NOTE: Follow this section only if you intend to use `TypeScript` instead of `JavaScript`.

Since release 3.2, the Node.js SDK has added full support for the link:https://www.typescriptlang.org/[TypeScript] programming language. 

[source,console]
----
$ npm install -g typescript ts-node
----

This will install TypeScript globally on your machine and allow you to run commands with the `tsc` cli. You will have noticed that we also install link:https://typestrong.org/ts-node/[ts-node] which is a handy execution utility that will help us run the example later on.

Run `tsc --init` in your project directory to generate a `tsconfig.json` file. This will set you up with some initial configurations, which should suffice for our purposes. 

Should you wish to make changes in future you can simply edit the file:

[source,json,indent=0]
----
include::project-docs:example$example-tsconfig.json[]
----

Note that the example above does not include the generated comments for readability.
