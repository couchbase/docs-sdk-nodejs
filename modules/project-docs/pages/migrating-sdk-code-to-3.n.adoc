= Migrating to SDK API 3
:description: The SDK API 3 (used in Node.js SDK 3.x and 4.x) introduces breaking changes to the previous SDK API 2 APIs (used in Node.js SDK 2.x) in order to provide a number of improvements. \
Collections and Scopes are introduced.

[abstract]
{description}
The Document class and structure has been completely removed from the API, and the returned value is now `Result`.
Retry behavior is more proactive, and lazy bootstrapping moves all error handling to a single place.

The current Node.js SDK 4.0 is also based on the xref:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#sdk3.2[SDK API 3.2 specification], and offers an entirely new backend (couchbase++) with better support for upcoming features like Distributed ACID Transactions.
We have increased the major version to reflect the importance of this implementation change as per https://semver.org/[semantic versioning].

The intent of this migration guide is to provide detail information on the changes and what to look for while upgrading the SDK.

NOTE: if you are an existing Node.js SDK 3._x_ user considering migrating to SDK 4.0,
you may wish to skip to the <<sdk4-specifics,SDK 4.0 specifics>> below.

== Fundamentals

Before this guide dives into the language-specific technical component of the migration, it is important to understand the high level changes first.
As a migration guide, this document assumes you are familiar with the previous generation of the SDK and does not re-introduce SDK API 2 concepts.
We recommend familiarizing yourself with the new SDK first by reading at least the xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[getting started guide], and browsing through the other chapters a little.

// end::intro[]

As an example here is a KeyValue document fetch:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/kv-operations.js[tag=get,indent=0]
----

Compare this to a N1QL query:

include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$migration.adoc[tag=new]


include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$migration.adoc[tag=lang]

==  Installation and Configuration

The Node.js SDK 3._x_ and 4._x_ are available through `npm`, just like the previous generation.
Please see the xref:sdk-release-notes.adoc[Release Notes] for up-to-date information.


The Node.js SDK 3.2 has the following dependencies:

[source,json]
----
  "dependencies": {
    "bindings": "^1.5.0",
    "debug": "^4.3.2",
    "nan": "^2.15.0",
    "parse-duration": "^1.0.0",
    "prebuild-install": "^6.1.4"
  },
----

The Node.js SDK 4.0 additionally requires Node 12+ (the oldest supported maintenance LTS release).


=== Connection to the Cluster


[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=connect,indent=0]
----

Similar to SDK API 2, if you create your own `ClusterEnvironment` the SDK will not shut it
down for you -- you need to do this manually at the end of the program lifetime:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=shutdown,indent=0]
----

Connection String Url Query Parameters

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=connstr,indent=0]
----


=== Authentication

Connecting with certificate-based authentication.

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/connecting-cert-auth.js[tag=connecting-cert-auth,indent=0]
----

Please see the xref:howtos:sdk-authentication.adoc[documentation on certificate-based authentication] for detailed information on how to configure this properly.


== Connection Lifecycle

From a high-level perspective, bootstrapping and shutdown is very similar to the SDK API 2._x_.
One notable difference is that the `Collection` is introduced and that the individual methods like `bucket` immediately return, and do not throw an exception.
Compare SDK API 2: the `openBucket` method would not work if it could not open the bucket.

The reason behind this change is that even if a bucket can be opened, a millisecond later it may not be available any more.
All this state has been moved into the actual operation so there is only a single place where the error handling needs to take place.
This simplifies error handling and retry logic for an application.

In SDK API 2, you connected, opened a bucket, performed a KV op, and disconnected like this:

[source,javascript]
----
const cluster = new couchbase.Cluster("127.0.0.1");
cluster.authenticate("user", "pass");
const bucket = cluster.openBucket("travel-sample");

const getResult = bucket.get("airline_10");

cluster.close();
----

Here is the SDK API 3 equivalent:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tags=simpleget;connect;shutdown,indent=0]
----

`Collections` is generally available from Couchbase Server 7.0 release, but the SDK already encoded it in its API to be future-proof.
If you are using a Couchbase Server version which does not support `Collections`, always use the `defaultCollection()` method to access the KV API; it will map to the full bucket.

IMPORTANT: You'll notice that `bucket(String)` returns immediately, even if the bucket resources are not completely opened.
This means that the subsequent `get` operation may be dispatched even before the socket is open in the background.
The SDK will handle this case transparently, and reschedule the operation until the bucket is opened properly.
This also means that if a bucket could not be opened (say, because no server was reachable) the operation will time out.
Please check the logs to see the cause of the timeout (in this case, you'll see socket connect rejections).

Also note, you will now find Query, Search, and Analytics at the `Cluster` level.
This is where they logically belong.
If you are using Couchbase Server 6.5 or later, you will be able to perform cluster-level queries even if no bucket is open.
If you are using an earlier version of the cluster you must open at least one bucket, otherwise cluster-level queries will fail.


== Serialization and Transcoding

In SDK API 2 the main method to control transcoding was through providing different `Document` instances (which in turn had their own transcoder associated), such as the `JsonDocument`.
This only worked for the KV APIs though -- Query, Search, Views, and other services exposed their JSON rows/hits in different ways.
All of this has been unified in SDK API 3 under a single concept: serializers and transcoders.

By default, all KV APIs transcode to and from JSON -- you can also provide Javascript objects which you couldn't in the past.

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=upsertandget,indent=0]
----

If you want to write binary data, you can use a `new RawBinaryTranscoder()`:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=rawbinary,indent=0]
----


== Exception Handling

How to _handle_ exceptions is unchanged from SDK API 2.
You should still use `try/catch` on the blocking APIs and the corresponding reactive/async methods on the other APIs.
There have been changes made in the following areas:

- Exception hierarchy and naming.
- Proactive retry where possible.


=== Exception hierarchy

The exception hierarchy is now flat and unified under a `CouchbaseError`.
Each `CouchbaseError` has an associated `ErrorContext` which is populated with as much info as possible and then dumped alongside the stack trace if an error happens.

Here is an example of the error context if a N1QL query is performed with an invalid syntax (i.e. `select 1= from`):

[source]
----
Exception in thread "main" com.couchbase.client.core.error.ParsingFailedException: Parsing of the input failed {"completed":true,"coreId":1,"errors":[{"code":3000,"message":"syntax error - at from"}],"idempotent":false,"lastDispatchedFrom":"127.0.0.1:62253","lastDispatchedTo":"127.0.0.1:8093","requestId":3,"requestType":"QueryRequest","retried":11,"retryReasons":["ENDPOINT_TEMPORARILY_NOT_AVAILABLE","BUCKET_OPEN_IN_PROGRESS"],"service":{"operationId":"9111b961-e585-42f2-9cab-e1501da7a40b","statement":"select 1= from","type":"query"},"timeoutMs":75000,"timings":{"dispatchMicros":15599,"totalMicros":1641134}}
----

=== Proactive Retry

One reason why the APIs do not expose a long list of exceptions is that the SDK now retries as many operations as it can if it can do so safely.
This depends on the type of operation (idempotent or not), in which state of processing it is (already dispatched or not), and what the actual response code is if it arrived already.
As a result, many transient cases -- such as locked documents, or temporary failure -- are now retried by default and should less often impact applications.
It also means, when migrating to SDK API 3, you may observe a longer period of time until an error is returned by default.

NOTE: Operations are retried by default as described above with the default `BestEffortRetryStrategy`.


== Migrating Services

The following section discusses each service in detail and covers specific bits that have not been covered by the more generic sections above.

=== Key Value

The Key/Value (KV) API is now located under the `Collection` interface, so even if you do not use collections, the `defaultCollection()` needs to be opened in order to access it.

The following table describes the SDK API 2 KV calls and where they are now located in SDK API 3:

.KV API Changes
[options="header"]
|====
| SDK API 2                      | SDK API 3

|`bucket.append`                 | `binarycollection.append`
|`bucket.prepend`                | `binarycollection.prepend`
|====

In addition, the datastructure APIs have been renamed and moved:

.Datastructure API Changes
[options="header"]
|====
| SDK API 2                      | SDK API 3
|`bucket.mapAdd`                 | `collection.map`
|`bucket.mapGet`                 | `collection.map`

|`bucket.queuePush`              | `collection.queue`
|`bucket.queuePop`               | `collection.queue`
|====

There are two important API changes:

* On the request side, overloads have been reduced and moved under a `Options` block
* On the response side, the return types have been unified.

The signatures now look very similar.
The concept of the `Document` as a type is gone in SDK API 3 and instead you need to pass in the properties explicitly.
This makes it very clear what is returned, especially on the response side.

Thus, the `get` method does not return a `Document` but a `GetResult` instead, and the `upsert` does not return a `Document` but a `MutationResult`.
Each of those results only contains the field that the specific method can actually return, making it impossible to accidentally try to access the `expiry` on the `Document` after a mutation, for example.

Instead of having many overloads, all optional params are now part of the `Option` block.
All required params are still part of the method signature, making it clear what is required and what is not (or has default values applied if not overridden).

The timeout can be overridden on every operation and now takes a `Duration` from java 8.
Compare SDK API 2 and SDK API 3 custom timeout setting:

[source,javascript]
----
// SDK API 2 custom timeout
bucket.get("mydoc-id", 5000);
----

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=customtimeout,indent=0]
----

In SDK API 2, the `getFromReplica` method had a `ReplicaMode` argument which allowed to customize its behavior on how many replicas should be reached.
We have identified this as a potential source of confusion and as a result split it up in two methods that simplify usage significantly.
There is now a `getAllReplicas` method and a `getAnyReplica` method.

* `getAllReplicas` asks the active node and all available replicas and returns the results as a stream.
* `getAnyReplica` uses `getAllReplicas`, and returns the first result obtained.

Unless you want to build some kind of consensus between the different replica responses, we recommend `getAnyReplica` for a fallback to a regular `get` when the active node times out.

NOTE: Operations which cannot be performed on JSON documents have been moved to the `binarycollection`, accessible through `Collection.binary()`.
These operations include `append`, `prepend`, `increment`, and `decrement` (previously called `counter` in SDK API 2).
These operations should only be used against non-json data.
Similar functionality is available through `mutateIn` on JSON documents.

=== Query

N1QL querying is now available at the `Cluster` level instead of the bucket level, because you can also write N1QL queries that span multiple buckets. Compare a simple N1QL query from SDK API 2 with its SDK API 3 equivalent:

[source,javascript]
----
// SDK API 2 simple query
queryResult = await bucket.query(
      couchbase.N1qlQuery.fromString('SELECT * FROM `travel-sample` WHERE city=$1 LIMIT 10'),
      [ 'Paris' ]);

queryResult.rows.forEach((row)=>{
      console.log(row);
   });
----

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=querysimple,indent=0]
----

Note that there is no `N1qlQuery.fromString` any more -- and query parameters argument has been moved to the options parameter for consistency reasons.
The following shows how to do named and positional parameters in SDK API 3:


[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=queryparameterized,indent=0]
----

Much of the non-row metadata has been moved into a specific `QueryMetaData` section:

It is no longer necessary to check for a specific error in the stream: if an error happened during processing it will throw an exception at the top level of the query.
The reactive streaming API will terminate the rows' `Flux` with an exception as well as soon as it is discovered.
This makes error handling much easier in both the blocking and non-blocking cases.

While in SDK API 2 you had to manually check for errors (otherwise you'd get an empty row collection):

[source,javascript]
----
const queryResult = bucket.query(N1qlQuery.simple("select 1="));
if (!queryResult.errors.isEmpty()) {
  // errors contain [{"msg":"syntax error - at end of input","code":3000}]
}
----

In SDK API 3 the top level `query` method will throw an exception:

[source]
----
Parsing of the input failed {"completed":true,"coreId":1,"errors":[{"code":3000,"message":"syntax error - at end of input"}],"idempotent":false,"lastDispatchedFrom":"127.0.0.1:51703","lastDispatchedTo":"127.0.0.1:8093","requestId":5,"requestType":"QueryRequest","retried":0,"service":{"operationId":"1c623a77-196a-4890-96cd-9d4f3f596477","statement":"select 1=","type":"query"},"timeoutMs":75000,"timings":{"dispatchMicros":13798,"totalMicros":70789}}
	at com.couchbase.client.java.AsyncUtils.block(AsyncUtils.java:51)
	at com.couchbase.client.java.Cluster.query(Cluster.java:225)
----

Not only does it throw a `CouchbaseError`, it also tries to map it to a specific exception type and include extensive contextual information for a better troubleshooting experience.

=== Analytics

Analytics querying, like N1QL, is also moved to the `Cluster` level: it is now accessible through the `Cluster.analyticsQuery` method.
As with the Query service, parameters for the Analytics queries have moved into the `AnalyticsOptions`:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=analyticssimple,indent=0]
----

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=analyticsparameterized,indent=0]
----

Also, errors will now be thrown as top level exceptions and it is no longer necessary to explicitly check for errors:

[source,java]
----
// SDK API 2 error check
AnalyticsQueryResult analyticsQueryResult = b1.query(AnalyticsQuery.simple("select * from foo"));
if (!analyticsQueryResult.errors().isEmpty()) {
  // errors contain [{"msg":"Cannot find dataset foo in dataverse Default nor an alias with name foo! (in line 1, at column 15)","code":24045}]
}
----

=== Search

The Search API has changed a bit in SDK API 3 so that it aligns with the other query APIs.
The type of queries have stayed the same, but all optional parameters moved into `SearchOptions`.
Also, similar to the other query APIs, it is now available at the `Cluster` level.

Here is a SDK API 2 Search query with some options, and its SDK API 3 equivalent:

[source,javascript]
----
//  SDK API 2 search query
const searchResult = bucket.query(
  "airports"",
  { indexName : "airport_view", limit:5, fields : [ "a", "b", "c"]}
  2000,
);
searchResult.rows.forEach((row)=>{
      console.log(row);
  });
}
----

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=searchsimple,indent=0]
----


If you want to be absolutely sure that you didn't get only partial data, you can check the error map:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=searchcheck,indent=0]
----

=== Views

Views have stayed at the `Bucket` level, because it does not have the concept of collections and is scoped at the bucket level on the server as well.
The API has stayed mostly the same, the most important change is that `staleness` is unified under the `ViewConsistency` enum.

.View Staleness Mapping
[options="header"]
|====
| SDK API 2                         | SDK API 3
|`Stale.TRUE`                       | `QueryScanConsistency.NotBounded`
|`Stale.FALSE`                      | `QuerywScanConsistency.RequestPlus`
|`Stale.UPDATE_AFTER`               | `removed`
|====

Compare this SDK API 2 view query with its SDK API 3 equivalent:

[source,javascript]
----
// SDK API 2 view query
const query = async bucket.query(
  "design", "view", {limit:5, skip:2},
  10000
);
query.rows.forEach((row)=>{
      console.log(row);
  });
}
----

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/migrating.js[tag=viewquery,indent=0]
----


=== Management APIs

In SDK API 2, the management APIs were centralized in the `clustermanager` at the cluster level and the `bucketmanager` at the bucket level.
Since SDK API 3 provides more management APIs, they have been split up in their respective domains.
So for example when in SDK API 2 you needed to remove a bucket you would call `clustermanager.removeBucket` you will now find it under `bucketmanager.dropBucket`.
Also, creating a N1QL index now lives in the `queryindexmanager`, which is accessible through the `cluster`.

The following table provides a mapping from the SDK API 2 management APIs to those of SDK API 3:

.`clustermanager` changes
[options="header"]

|====

=== Encryption

Due to a change in algorithms and API, SDK API 2 cannot read fields encrypted by SDK API 3.
Learn more in the xref:howtos:encrypting-using-sdk.adoc#migrating-from-2[encryption guide].

[#sdk4-specifics]
== SDK 4.x specifics

Node.js SDK 4.0 implements the SDK API 3 spec, so all the steps above also apply to a migration from a Node.js SDK 2.x directly to Node.js SDK 4.0.

Additionally, the Node.js SDK 4.0 offers a new backend (Couchbase++) with support for 
xref:howtos:distributed-acid-transactions-from-the-sdk.adoc[multi-document ACID transactions],
as well as the capabilities required for upcoming features.
You should be aware of the following considerations arising from this new backend implementation.

The following features are unsupported in 4.0. 
They are available in 3.2, and will be available in a later 4.x release.

* xref:concept-docs:response-time-observability.adoc[Response Time Availability]
* xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#older-server-versions[Legacy durability]
* Log forwarding
* Replica reads

In addition:

* The required minimum version of Node.js is now v12 (the oldest supported maintenance LTS release).
* Ping error entries are now typed.
* `get` requests on locked documents now retry rather than fast-fail.
* The changes to xref:ref:client-settings.adoc[Client Settings] are documented in the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client-4.0.0/interfaces/ConnectOptions.html[API reference].
* The changes to xref:howtos:managing-connections.adoc#connection-strings[Connection Strings] are documented in the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client-4.0.0/functions/connect.html[API reference].
