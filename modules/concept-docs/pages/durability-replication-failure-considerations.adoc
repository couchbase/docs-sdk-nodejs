{description}
Even the most reliable software and hardware might fail at some point, and along with the failures, introduce a chance of data loss.
Couchbaseâ€™s durability features include Synchronous Replication, and the possibility to use distributed, multi-document ACID transactions.
It is the responsibility of the development team and the software architect to evaluate the best choice for each use case.

== Older Server Versions
// include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc[tag=older]
If a version of Couchbase Server lower than 6.5 is being used then the fallback is 'client verified' durability.

WARN: Client Verified durability is supported in xref:3.2@durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#older-server-versions[Node.js SDK 3.2] but not in 4.0.
Legacy support will be available in a later 4.x release.
See the xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc#sdk4-specifics[SDK 4.0 migration considerations].
