{description}

Working in distributed environments is _hard_.
Latencies come and go, so do connections in their entirety.
Is it a network glitch, or is the remote cluster down?
Sometimes just knowing the likely cause is enough to get a good start on a workaround, or at least avoid hours wasted on an inappropriate solution.

Health Check enables useful diagnostics on the state of Couchbase Clusters across networks.
`Ping` and `diagnostics` methods on the bucket and cluster objects respectively, can give us information about the current state of nodes, and their connections.

== Uses

'Ping` provides a raw JSON payload suitable for feeding into reactive log and aggregation components, including monitoring systems like _Splunk_, _ElasticSearch_, and _Nagios_.
It can also help keep connections alive if you are operating across an environment which aggressively closes down unused connections.

`Diagnostics` provides a strongly typed API for proactive, pull-based monitoring systems, such as:

* https://kubernetes.io/docs/tasks/configure-pod-container/configure-liveness-readiness-probes/[Kubernetes Liveness and Readiness Probes via HTTP or CLI commands].
* https://docs.docker.com/engine/reference/builder/#healthcheck[Docker Health Check with CLI commands].
* http://docs.aws.amazon.com/elasticloadbalancing/latest/classic/elb-healthchecks.html[AWS ELB through HTTP].

This API does not provide binary yes/no answers about the health of the cluster; rather it summarizes as much information as possible, for the application developer to assemble a complete, contextual view and come to a conclusion.

Note: `Ping` may reopen a connection, so is not without side-effects.
`Diagnostics` shows what the SDK _perceives_ as the current state of the network and services -- it is without side-effects, but may not be up to date.


== Ping

At its simplest, `ping` provides information about the current state of the connections in the Couchbase Cluster, by actively polling:

[source,javascript]
----
const result = await cluster.ping();
console.log(result);
/*
{
  config_rev: 3,
  id: '0x103828d70/41115255fb1e3c76',
  sdk: 'libcouchbase/3.0.6-njs couchnode/3.0.7 (node/12.18.2; v8/7.8.279.23-node.39; ssl/1.1.1g)',
  services: {
    kv: [
        {
            id: '0x10410c8d0',
            latency_us: 5577,
            local: '127.0.0.1:54985',
            namespace: 'default',
            remote: 'localhost:54979',
            status: 'ok'
        },
        ...
    ],
    n1ql: [ ... ],
    views: [ ... ]
  },
  version: 1
}
*/
----

This will print the latency for each socket (endpoint) connected per service. More information is available on the classes.

By default the SDK will ping all services available on the target cluster.
You can customize the type of services to ping through the `PingOptions`:

[source,javascript]
----
const result = await cluster.ping({
    serviceTypes: [
        couchbase.ServiceType.Query,
    ]
});
----

In this example, only the Query Service is included in the ping report.

Note that `ping` is available both on the `Cluster` and the `Bucket` level.
The difference is that at the cluster level, the key-value service might not be included based on the Couchbase Server version in use.
If you want to make sure the key-value service is included, perform it at the bucket level.


== Diagnostics

`Diagnostics` returns a list of the nodes that the SDK currently has (or had) a connection to, and the current status of the connection.
However this call _does not_ actively poll the nodes, reporting instead the state the last time it tried to access each node.
If you want the _current_ status, then use xref:#ping[Ping].

[source,javascript]
----
const result = await bucket.diagnostics();
console.log(result)
/*
{
    "id":"0x10290d100","kv":[
        {
            "id":"0000000072b21d66",
            "last_activity_us":2363294,
            "local":"10.112.195.1:51473",
            "remote":"10.112.195.101:11210",

        },

    ],
