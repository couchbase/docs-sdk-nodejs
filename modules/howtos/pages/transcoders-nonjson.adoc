{description}
Custom transcoders and serializers provide support for applications needing to perform advanced operations, including supporting non-JSON data.

The Node SDK uses the concepts of transcoders and serializers, which are used whenever data is sent to or retrieved from Couchbase Server.

When sending data to Couchbase, the SDK passes the Object being sent to a transcoder.
The transcoder can either reject the Object as being unsupported, or convert it into a `Buffer` and a Common Flag.
The Common Flag specifies whether the data is JSON, a non-JSON string, or raw binary data.
It may, but does not have to, use a serializer to perform the byte conversion.

On retrieving data from Couchbase, the fetched `Buffer` and Common Flag are passed to a transcoder.  
The transcoder converts the bytes into a concrete class (the application specifies the required type) if possible.  
It may use a serializer for this.

NOTE: Many applications will not need to be aware of transcoders and serializers, as the defaults support most standard JSON use cases.
The information in this page is only needed if the application has an advanced use-case, likely involving either non-JSON data, non-string data, non-binary data, or a requirement for a particular JSON serialization library.

== Default Behaviour
The `ClusterEnvironment` contains a global transcoder, which by default is  `defaulttranscoder`.

On sending data to Couchbase, `defaulttranscoder` will send 
Buffer objects through untouched, 
string objects to Buffer.from(obj), and other objects 
through JSON.stringify(obj) and then Buffer.from(...)
JSON.stringify will reject any non JSON object with 'bad value passed'.
The serialized bytes are then sent to the Couchbase Server, along with a Common Flag of JSON.

On retrieving data from Couchbase, `defaulttranscoder` passes the fetched `Buffer` and Common Flag to its serializer (`DefaultJsonSerializer` by default) to convert into a concrete class.

This table summarizes that information, and this more concise form will be used to describe the other transcoders included in the SDK.

== Non-JSON Transcoders
It is most common to store JSON with Couchbase.
However, it is possible to store non-JSON documents, such as raw binary data.

NOTE: It's important to note that the Couchbase Data Platform includes multiple components other than the Key-Value store -- including N1QL and its indexes, FTS, analytics, and eventing -- and these are optimized for JSON and will either ignore or provide limited functionality with non-JSON documents.

Also note that some simple data types can be stored directly as JSON, without recourse to non-JSON transcoding.
A valid JSON document can be a simple integer (`42`), string (`"hello"`), array (`[1,2,3]`), boolean (`true`, `false`) and the JSON `null` value.

The following examples of a RawStringTranscoder and a RawBinaryTranscoder are somewhat contrived, as the defaulttranscoder provices support for both string and binary (Buffer) objects.

=== RawStringTranscoder
The RawStringTranscoder provides the ability for the user to explicitly store and retrieve raw string data with Couchbase.
It can be used to avoid the overhead of storing the string as JSON, which requires two bytes for double quotes, plus potentially more for escaping characters.

Note that this transcoder does not accept a serializer, and always performs straight passthrough of the data to the server.  It only accepts strings.

Here’s an example of using the `RawStringTranscoder`:

----

=== RawBinaryTranscoder
The RawBinaryTranscoder provides the ability for the user to explicitly store and retrieve raw byte data to Couchbase.
The transcoder does not perform any form of real transcoding, and does not take a serializer, but rather passes the data through and assigns the appropriate binary Common Flag.

== Custom Transcoders and Serializers
More advanced transcoding needs can be accomplished if the application implements their own transcoders 
and serializers.

=== Creating a Custom Transcoder
We saw above two examples of custom transcoders with  `RawStringTranscoder` and `RawBinaryTranscoder`

It’s easy to create a transcoders.  Simply implement the Transcoder interface’s two methods:
[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/rawstringtranscoder.js[tag=customtranscoder_interface,indent=0]
----

// In this case, there is no need to provide a custom transcoder - 
// The <<Default Behaviour,table for `defaulttranscoder`>> shows that it already does what we need: 
// for any Object (that’s not a `Buffer`), it sends it to its serializer, and then stores the 
// result in Couchbase with the JSON Common Flag set.

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/rawstringtranscoder.js[tag=customtranscoder_encode,indent=0]
----

And for decoding:

[source,javascript]

include::devguide:example$nodejs/rawstringtranscoder.js[tag=customtranscoder_decode,indent=0]
