{description}

FTS allows you to create, manage, and query full-text indexes on JSON documents stored in Couchbase buckets.

It uses natural language processing for querying documents, provides relevance scoring on the results of your queries, and has fast indexes for querying a wide range of possible text searches.

Supported query types include simple queries like Match and Term queries; range queries like Date Range and Numeric Range; and compound queries for conjunctions, disjunctions, and/or boolean queries.

The Node.js SDK exposes an API for performing FTS queries which abstracts some of the complexity of using the underlying REST API.


// As of Couchbase Server 6.5, FTS...

== Examples

Search queries are executed at the cluster level (not bucket or collection). All examples below will console log our returned documents along with their metadata and rows, each returned document has an index, id, score and sort value.

.Match

Using the `travel-sample` xref:{version-server}@server:manage:manage-settings/install-sample-buckets.adoc[Sample Bucket], we define an FTS SearchQuery using the `match()` method to search for the specified term: `"five-star"`.

.Match Phrase

An FTS SearchQuery using the `matchPhrase()` method to find a specified phrase: `"10-minute walk from the"`.

----


When searching for a phrase we get some additional benefits outside of the `match()` method. The match phrase query for ``"10-minute walk from the"`` will produce the following hits from our travel-sample dataset:

[source,bash]
----
hits:
  hotel_11331: "10-minute walk from village"
  hotel_15915: "10 minute walk from Echo Arena"
  hotel_3606: "10 minute walk to the centre"
  hotel_28259: "10 minute walk to the coastal path"
----


If you run this code, notice that we matched `"10-minute"` with three additional hits on `"10 minute"` (without the dash). So, we get some of the same matches on variations of that term just as we would with a regular `match()` method search, however;  notice that `"walk from the"` hits on several variations of this phrase: `"walk from"` (where `"the"` was removed) and `"walk to the"` (where `"from"` was removed). This is specific to searching phrases and helps provide us with various matches relevant to our search.

.Date Range

Here we define an FTS SearchQuery that uses the `dateRange()` method to search for hotels where the updated field (`datetime`) falls within a specified date range.

.Conjunction

A query satisfying multiple child queries. The example below will only return two documents hitting on the term `"five-star"` and the phrase `"luxury hotel"` while no other documents match both criteria.

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/search-conjuncts-disjuncts.js[tag=search-query-conjuncts]
----

Note: Our match for `"five-star"` was not exact, but still produced a result because a similar term was found `"Five star"`, we could have potentially matched `"5 star"` or the word `"five"`. When you work with any full-text search the number of hits you get and their score are variable.


.Disjunction

A query satisfying (by default) one query or another. If a conjunction query can be thought of like using an `AND` operator, a disjunction would be like using an `OR` operator. The example below will return seven documents hitting on the term `"Louvre"` and five hits on the term `"Eiffel"` returning a total of 12 rows together as part of a disjunction query.

== Working with Results

As with all query result types in the Node.js SDK, the search query results object contains two properties. The hits reflecting the documents that matched your query, emitted as rows. Along with the metadata available in the meta property.

Metadata holds additional information not directly related to your query, such as success total hits and how long the query took to execute in the cluster.

== Scan Consistency and ConsistentWith
By default, all Search queries will return the data from whatever is in the index at the time of query.
These semantics can be tuned if needed so that the hits returned include the most recently performed mutations, at the cost of slightly higher latency since the index needs to be updated first.

There are two ways to control consistency: either by supplying a custom `SearchScanConsistency` or using `consistentWith`.
Like the majority of Couchbase query services, FTS allows `RequestPlus` queries --
_Read-Your-Own_Writes (RYOW)_ consistency, ensuring results contain information from
updated indexes:
