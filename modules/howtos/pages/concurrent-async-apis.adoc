[abstract]
The Couchbase Node.js SDK allows the use, and mixing, of two distinct forms of
result handling.

The Node.js SDK provides two APIs, which can be freely mixed:

* A simple promises approach, available in the newest editions of Javascript.
* A standard callback based approach, typical of Node.js.


== Using the Promises API

This is the simplest API, in which all operations can be directly waited upon.  
A simple upsert example looks like this:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/kv-operations.js[tag=get,indent=0]
----

Methods will return a Javascript 'Promise' object, which can be chained, joined
or handled.

An example of performing a couple of operations simultanously with the Promises
API looks like this:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/kv-operations.js[tag=promises,indent=0]
----


== Using the Callback API

In addition to the Promises approach, we also simultaneously support the
standard callback approach which is well known.  A simple get example
looks like this:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/kv-operations.js[tag=callback,indent=0]
----


== Batching

As Node.js inherently performs all operations in an asynchronous manner, no
special implementation is required in order to enable batching.  Simply
perform a number of operations simultaenously and they will be batched on
the network.  This happens internally and is highly efficient.

Note that this behaviour extends to the world of async/await, such that
following would be automatically batched across the network:

[source,javascript]
----
include::devguide:example$nodejs/kv-operations.js[tag=batch,indent=0]
----


== Choosing an API
So which API should you choose?

It's really down to you and the needs of your application.  
If you're already writing code using promises, then it makes sense to continue that way.
If you working with a legacy application which is still using the standard callback approach, it may make sense to continue using callbacks.
