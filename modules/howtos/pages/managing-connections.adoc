== Waiting for Bootstrap Completion

Depending on the environment and network latency, bootstrapping the SDK fully might take a little longer than the default key-value timeout of 2.5 seconds, so you may see timeouts during bootstrap. 
To prevent those early timeouts from happening, you can use the `waitUntilReady` method.

If you are working at the _Cluster_ level, then add to the `cluster()` in the xref:#connecting-to-a-cluster[earlier example]:

[source,java]
----
Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("127.0.0.1", "Administrator", "password");
cluster.waitUntilReady(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
Bucket bucket = cluster.bucket("travel-sample");
Collection collection = bucket.defaultCollection();
----

Or more fully:

[source,java]
----
public class ClusterExample {
  public static void main(String... args) throws Exception {
    Cluster cluster = Cluster.connect("127.0.0.1", "Administrator", "password");
    cluster.waitUntilReady(Duration.ofSeconds(10));
    Bucket bucket = cluster.bucket("travel-sample");
    Collection collection = bucket.defaultCollection();
  }
}
----

If you are working at the _Bucket_ level, then the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-java-client/com/couchbase/client/java/Bucket.html#waitUntilReady-java.time.Duration-[Bucket-level `waitUntilReady`] does the same as the Cluster-level version,
_plus_ it waits for the K-V (data) sockets to be ready.

// Other timeout issues may occur when using the SDK located geographically separately from the Couchbase Server cluster -- this is xref:project-docs:compatibility#[not recommended].
// See the xref:#working-in-the-cloud[Cloud section] below for some suggestions of settings adjustments.
