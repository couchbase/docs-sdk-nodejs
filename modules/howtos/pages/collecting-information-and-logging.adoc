IMPORTANT: the Logging implementation has changed substantially in 4.x.
Customized logging is not yet implemented, this will be resolved in a future 4.x release.
Use of the console logger (detailed below) is currently recommended.

== Library logging

The Node.js SDK allows logging via the `CBPPLOGLEVEL` environment variable.
// TODO: This section seems outdated? Unclear what we should keep and what needs to be discarded for SDK 4.x.
// The Node.js SDK offers a basic logging facility through which its various subsystems can output
// debug and error information.
// This information provides details of the library's internals and additional error information
// which may otherwise not be accessible via other APIs.
// Logging may be enabled via the `debug` library, an environment variable, or a connection string directive.

// The most common way to enable logging is to set the `DEBUG` environment variable to `couchnode*`.
// Alternatively you can set the `LCB_LOGLEVEL` environment variable to a number between 1 and 5,
// with 5 being the most verbose and 1 being the least verbose.  Also, the query parameter
// `console_log_level` can be used to set the log level.
Note that these logs will go to `stdout` (standard output).

=== Environmental Settings

In the command line environment, the `CBPPLOGLEVEL` variable is set as follows:

.GNU/Linux and Mac
[source,console]
----
export CBPPLOGLEVEL=<log-level>
----

.Windows
[source,console]
----
set CBPPLOGLEVEL=<log-level>
----

== Log Levels

You can increase the log level for greater verbosity (more information) in the logs:

* off -- disables all logging, which is normally set by default.
* error -- error messages.
* warn -- error notifications.
* info -- useful notices, not often.
* debug -- diagnostic information, required to investigate problems.
* trace -- the most verbose level.

When logging is turned on, the SDK will output messages similar to this:

[source,console]
----
[2022-05-17 15:23:46.221] [85833,13741777] [debug] 1ms, [2aed64fd-5d38-416a-cc09-e67c371b8444]: use default CA for TLS verify
----

// TODO: Is this still valid? Unclear what 'options' we are referring to...
// NOTE: The output format is subject to change.
// It is intended for human consumption and is not designed to be parseable.
// Different formats can be specified by providing a custom logging function in the 'options' argument.

// The following table describes the components of the log entries:

// [cols="50,213"]
// |===
// | Format | Description

// | `nms`
// | The number of milliseconds elapsed since the loading of the library

// | `[In]`
// | The identifier of the `lcb_t` object associated with the current message.
// This allows you to determine the origin of the message in the case where the application contains multiple such `lcb_t` objects.
// The number is incremented for each call to [.api]`lcb_create()`

// | `+{PID}+`
// | The current thread/process identifier.
// On Linux this is also the process ID for single-threaded programs, further helping distinguish between multiple forks of an application.

// | `[LEVEL]`
// | A string representing the severity of the level

// | `(subsystem - L:line)`
// | The _subsystem_ that produced this message, followed by the source code line at which this message was created.
// The subsystem will typically, but not always, resemble the source code file.
// It is a small string describing what the current line is doing.

// | `<host:port>`
// | The host and port, if any, associated with the message.
// This is supplied for messages that relate to the state of a particular connection.
// |===

== Additional Information

The Node.js SDK internally uses the libcouchbase API (since 4.0 implemented by the Couchbase++ library) to perform operations.
If more in depth debug information is required such as Stack Traces or Memory Leak Detection, you can find more information on how to achieve this in xref:c-sdk:howtos:collecting-information-and-logging.adoc[the C SDK documentation].
