Common use cases are outlined here, more recherch√© use cases are covered in the https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client/[API docs].

The Node.js SDK also comes with some convenience functionality for common Couchbase management requests.


Management operations in the SDK may be performed through several interfaces depending on the object:

* BucketManager -- `Cluster.buckets()`
* UserManager -- `Cluster.users()`
* QueryIndexManager -- `Cluster.queryIndexes()`
* AnalyticsIndexManager -- `Cluster.analyticsIndexes()`
* SearchIndexManager -- `Cluster.searchIndexes()`
* CollectionManager -- `Bucket.collections()`
* ViewIndexManager -- `Bucket.viewIndexes()`.

NOTE: When using a Couchbase version earlier than 6.5, you must create a valid Bucket connection using `cluster.bucket(name)` before you can use cluster level managers.


== Creating and Removing Buckets

The `BucketManager` interface may be used to create and delete buckets from the Couchbase cluster.
It is instantiated through the `Cluster.buckets()` method.

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$provisioning.js[tag=create-bucketmgr,indent=0]
----

The `CreateBucketSettings` and `BucketSettings` structs are used for creating and updating buckets, `BucketSettings` is also used for exposing information about existing buckets.

include::6.5@sdk:shared:partial$flush-info-pars.adoc[tag=update-bucket-warning]


Here is the list of parameters available:

|====
| Name | Description | Can be updated
| `name string` | The name of the bucket, required for creation. | false
| `flushEnabled boolean` | Enables flushing to be performed on this bucket (see the <<flushing>> section below). | true
| `replicaIndex boolean` | Whether or not to replicate indexes. | false
| `ramQuotaMB uint64` | How much memory should each node use for the bucket, required for creation. | true
| `numReplicas uint32` | The number of replicas to use for the bucket. | true
| `bucketType BucketType` | The type of the bucket, required for creation. | false
| `evictionPolicy EvictionPolicyType` | The type of the eviction to use for the bucket, defaults to `valueOnly`. | true (note: changing will cause the bucket to restart causing temporary inaccessibility)
| `maxTTL time.Duration` | The default maximum time-to-live to apply to documents in the bucket. (note: This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.) | true
| `compressionMode CompressionMode` | The compression mode to apply to documents in the bucket. (note: This option is only available for Couchbase and Ephemeral buckets in Couchbase Enterprise Edition.) | true
|====

The following example creates a "hello" bucket:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$provisioning.js[tag=create-bucket,indent=0]
----

We can now get this bucket and update it to enable flush:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$provisioning.js[tag=update-bucket,indent=0]
----

Once you no longer need to use the bucket, you can remove it:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$provisioning.js[tag=remove-bucket,indent=0]
----


[#flushing]
== Flushing Buckets

include::6.5@sdk:shared:partial$flush-info-pars.adoc[tag=flush-intro]

You can flush a bucket in the SDK by using the `flush` method:


[source,javascript]
----
include::example$provisioning.js[tag=flush-bucket,indent=0]
----

The `flush` operation may fail if the bucket does not have flush enabled, in that case it will return an error.


== Collection Management

The https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client/CollectionManager.html[`CollectionManager`] interface may be used to create and delete scopes from the Couchbase cluster.
It is instantiated through the `Bucket.collections()` method.

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$collection-manager.js[tag=create-collection-manager,indent=0]
----

You can create a scope:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$collection-manager.js[tag=create-scope,indent=0]
----

You can then create a collection within that scope:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$collection-manager.js[tag=create-collection,indent=0]
----

Finally, you can drop unneeded collections and scopes:

[source,javascript]
----
include::example$collection-manager.js[tag=drop-collection,indent=0]

include::example$collection-manager.js[tag=drop-scope,indent=0]
----

== Index Management

In general, you will rarely need to work with Index Managers from the SDK.
For those occasions when you do, please see the relevant API docs:

* QueryIndexManager -- https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client/QueryIndexManager.html[`Cluster.queryIndexes()`];
* AnalyticsIndexManager -- https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client/AnalyticsIndexManager.html[`Cluster.analyticsIndexes()`];
* SearchIndexManager -- https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client/SearchIndexManager.html[`Cluster.searchIndexes()`];
* ViewIndexManager -- https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-node-client/ViewIndexManager.html[`Bucket.viewIndexes()`].
