[abstract]
You can query for documents in Couchbase using the N1QL query language, a language based on SQL, but designed for structured and flexible JSON documents.
Querying can solve typical programming tasks such as finding a user profile by email address, facebook login, or user ID.


Our query service uses N1QL, which will be fairly familiar to anyone who's used any dialect of SQL.
xref:#_additional_resources[Further resources] for learning about N1QL are listed at the bottom of the page.
Before you get started you may wish to checkout the xref:6.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[N1QL intro page], or just dive in with a query against our travel sample data set.
In this case, the one thing that you need to know is that in order to make a Bucket queryable, it must have at least one index defined.
You can define a _primary_ index on a bucket.
When a primary index is defined you can issue non-covered queries on the bucket as well.

Use
xref:6.5@server::tools/cbq-shell.html[cbq], our interactive Query shell.
Open it, and enter the following:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE PRIMARY INDEX ON `travel-sample`
----

or replace _travel-sample_ with a different Bucket name to build an index on a different dataset.

NOTE: The default installation places cbq in `/opt/couchbase/bin/` on Linux, `/Applications/Couchbase Server.app/Contents/Resources/couchbase-core/bin/cbq` on OS X, and `C:\Program Files\Couchbase\Server\bin\cbq.exe` on Microsoft Windows.

// TODO: improving this and/or adding server/6.0/tools/query-workbench.html


== Queries & Placeholders

Placeholders allow you to specify variable constraints for an otherwise constant query.
There are two variants of placeholders: postional and named parameters.
Positional parameters use an ordinal placeholder for substitution and named parameters use variables.
A named or positional parameter is a placeholder for a value in the WHERE, LIMIT or OFFSET clause of a query.
Note that both parameters and options are optional.

.Positional parameter example:
[source,javascript]
----
var result = await cluster.query(
    'SELECT x.* FROM `default` WHERE x.Type=$1',
    {parameters: ['Users']});
----

.Named parameter example:
[source,javascript]
----
var parameters = new QueryParameters()
    .Add('type', 'User');
var options = new QueryOptions();

var result = await cluster.query(
    'SELECT x.* FROM `default` WHERE x.Type=$type',
    {'type': 'User'});
----

// The complete code for this page's example can be found at xref:[??]



== Handling Results

In most cases your query will return more than one result, and you may be looking to iterate over those results:

[source,javascript]
----
var result = await cluster.query(
    'SELECT x.* FROM `default` WHERE x.Type=$0',
    ['User']);

// iterate over rows
result.rows.forEach((row) => {
    // each row is an object representing the row result
    var name = row.username; // "mike"
    var age = row.age;
});
----

== Scan Consistency


Setting a staleness parameter for queries, with `scan_consistency`, enables a tradeoff between latency and (eventual) consistency.

* A N1QL query using the default *Not Bounded* Scan Consistency will not wait for any indexes to finish updating before running the query and returning results, meaning that results are returned quickly, but the query will not return any documents that are yet to be indexed.

* With Scan Consistency set to *RequestPlus*, all document changes and index updates are processed before the query is run.
Select this when consistency is always more important than performance.

* For a middle ground, *AtPlus* is a 'read your own write' (RYOW) option, which means it just waits for the new documents that you specify to be indexed, rather than an entire index of multiple documents.
// See the xref:scan-consistency-examples.adoc[examples] for how to use *AtPlus* for the best performance balance for many circumstances.

.ScanConsisteny (RYOW)
[source,javascript]
----
// create / update document (mutation)
var upsertResult = await collection.upsert('id', {name: 'Mike', type: 'User'});

// create mutation state from mutation results
var state = couchbase.MutationState.from(upsertResult);

// use mutation state with query option
var result = await cluster.query(
    'SELECT x.* FROM `default` WHERE x.Type=$1',
    ['User'], {
        consistentWith: state,
    });
----

== Streaming Large Result Sets

The Node.js SDK supports a number of methods for performing queries, all through the same interface.  If you await on the result, or utilize a callback to receive the results, the entire resultset will be downloaded and cached before being returned.  If you wish to stream the results, you can use the result as an event emitter in order to row-by-row process the results.  Using the event emitter prevents the SDK from needing to cache the rows internally, and allows you to stream the results.

.Streaming
[source,javascript]
----
var result = cluster.query(
    'SELECT x.* FROM `default` WHERE x.Type="User"');
result.on('row', (row) => {
    // handle the row
    var name = row.name;
});
result.on('end', (meta) => {
    // finish processing and handle the meta
});
----

== Additional Resources

NOTE: N1QL is not the only query option in Couchbase.
Be sure to check that your use case fits your selection of query service.

// For a deeper dive into N1QL from the SDK, refer to our xref:concept:[N1QL SDK concept doc].

The xref:6.0@server:n1ql:n1ql-language-reference/index.adoc[Server doc N1QL intro] introduces up a complete guide to the N1QL language, including all of the latest additions.

The http://query.pub.couchbase.com/tutorial/#1[N1QL interactive tutorial] is a good introduction to the basics of N1QL use.
