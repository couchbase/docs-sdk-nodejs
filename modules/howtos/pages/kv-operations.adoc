== Documents

A _document_ refers to an entry in the database (other databases may refer to the same concept as a _row_).
A document has an ID (_primary key_ in other databases), which is unique to the document and by which it can be located.
The document also has a value which contains the actual application data.
See xref:concept-docs:documents.adoc[the concept guide to _Documents_] for a deeper dive into documents in the Couchbase Data Platform.
Or read on, for a hands-on introduction to working with documents from the Node.js SDK.

== CRUD Operations

The core interface to Couchbase Server is simple KV operations on full documents.
Make sure you're familiar with the basics of authorization and connecting to a Cluster from the xref:hello-world:start-using-sdk.adoc[Start Using the SDK section].
We're going to expand on the short _Upsert_ example we used there, adding options as we move through the various CRUD operations.
Here is the _Insert_ operation at its simplest:

.Insert
[source,javascript]
----
var document = {foo: 'bar', bar: 'foo'};
var result = await collection.insert('document-key', document);
----

Options may be added to operations:

.Insert (with options)
[source,javascript]
----
var document = {foo: 'bar', bar: 'foo'};
var result = await collection.insert('document-key', document, {
    cas: SOME_CAS,
    timeout: 10000, // 10 seconds
});
----

Setting a Compare and Swap (CAS) value is a form of optimistic locking - dealt with in depth in the xref:concurrent-document-mutations.adoc[CAS page].
Here we just note that the CAS is a value representing the current state of an item; each time the item is modified, its CAS changes.
The CAS value is returned as part of a document’s metadata whenever a document is accessed.

_timeout_ is an optional parameter which is represented in milliseconds.
Timeout sets the timeout value for the operation. We will add to these options
for the _Replace_ example:

[source,javascript]
----
var document = {foo: 'bar', bar: 'foo'};
var result = await collection.replace('document-key', document, {
    cas: SOME_CAS,
    expiration: 60, // 60 seconds
    timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
});
----

Expiration sets an explicit time to live (TTL) for a document, for which you can also xref:sdk-xattr-example.adoc[see a more detailed example of TTL discovery] later in the docs.
We'll discuss modifying `Expiration` in more details xref:#expiration-ttl[below].
For a discussion of item (Document) _vs_ Bucket expiration, see the 
xref:6.5@server:learn:buckets-memory-and-storage/expiration.adoc#expiration-bucket-versus-item[Expiration Overview page].


== Durability

[source,javascript]
----
var document = {foo: 'bar', bar: 'foo'};
var result = await collection.Upsert('document-key', document, {
    cas: SOME_CAS,
    expiration: 60, // 60 seconds
    persistTo: 1,
    replicateTo: 1,
    timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
});
----

Here, we have add _Durability_ options, namely `persistTo` and `replicateTo`.
In Couchbase Server releases before 6.5, Durability was set with these two options 
-- see the xref:2.6@nodejs-sdk::durability.adoc[6.0 Durability documentation] 
-- covering  how many replicas the operation must be propagated to and how many persisted copies of the modified record must exist. 

If 6.5 or above is being used, you can take advantage of the xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#durable-writes[Durable Write] feature, 
in which Couchbase Server will only return success to the SDK after the requested replication level has been achieved. 
The three replication levels are:

 * `Majority` - The server will ensure that the change is available in memory on the majority of configured replicas.
 * `MajorityAndPersistToActive` - Majority level, plus persisted to disk on the active node.
 * `PersistToMajority` - Majority level, plus persisted to disk on the majority of configured replicas.

The options are in increasing levels of safety. 
Note that nothing comes for free - for a given node, waiting for writes to storage is considerably slower than waiting for it to be available in-memory.
These trade offs, as well as which settings may be tuned, are discussed in the xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#durable-writes[durability page].

The following example demonstrates using the newer durability features available in Couchbase server 6.5 onwards.

[source,javascript]
----
var document = {foo: 'bar', bar: 'foo'};
var result = await collection.Upsert('document-key', document, {
  case: SOME_CAS,
  expiration: 60, // 60 seconds,
  durabilityLevel: couchbase.DurabilityLevel.Majority,
  timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
});
----

To stress, durability is a useful feature but should not be the default for most applications, as there is a performance consideration, 
and the default level of safety provided by Couchbase will be reasonable for the majority of situations.

[TIP]
.Sub-Document Operations
====
All of these operations involve fetching the complete document from the Cluster.
Where the number of operations or other circumstances make bandwidth a significant issue, the SDK can work on just a specific _path_ of the document with xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Docunent Operations].
====

== Retrieving full documents

Using the `get()` method with the document key can be done in a similar fashion to the other operations:

[source,javascript]
----
var result = await collection.get('document-key');
var content = result.content;
----

Timeout can also be set - as in the earlier `Insert` example:

.Get (with options)
[source,javascript]
----
var result = await collection.get('document-key', {
    timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
});
var content = result.content;
----


== Removing

When removing a document, you will have the same concern for durability as with any additive modification to the Bucket:

.Remove (with options)
[source,javascript]
----
var result = await collection.remove('document-key', {
    cas: SOME_CAS,
    persistTo: 1,
    replicateTo: 1,
    timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
    }
);
----

== Expiration / TTL

By default, Couchbase documents do not expire, but transient or temporary data may be needed for user sessions, caches, or other temporary documents. 
Using `touch()`, you can set expiration values on documents to handle transient data:

[source,javascript]
----
var result = await collection.touch('document-key', 10000);
----

A network timeout can be set with the options, in the same fashion as earlier examples on this page:

[source,javascript]
----
var result = await collection.touch('document-key', 30000, {
    timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
});
----

== Atomic document modifications

The value of a document can be increased or decreased atomically using `binary().increment()` and `binary().decrement()`.

.Increment
[source,javascript]
----
// increment binary value by 1
await collection.binary().increment('document-key', 1);
----

.Increment (with options)
[source,javascript]
----
// increment binary value by 1, if document doesn’t exist, seed it at 1000
await collection.binary().increment('document-key', 1, {
    initial: 1000,
    timeout: 5000, // 5 seconds
});
----

.Decrement
[source,csharp]
----
// decrement binary value by 1
await collection.binary().decrement('document-key', 1);
----

.Decrement (with options)
[source,csharp]
----
// decrement binary value by 1, if document doesn’t exist, seed it at 1000
await collection.binary().decrement('document-key', 1, {
    initial: 1000,
    cas: SOME_CAS
});
----

NOTE: Increment & Decrement are considered part of the ‘binary’ API and as such may still be subject to change

== Additional Resources

Working on just a specific path within a JSON document will reduce network bandwidth requirements - see the xref:subdocument-operations.adoc[Sub-Document] pages.
For working with metadata on a document, reference our xref:sdk-xattr-example.adoc[Extended Attributes] pages.

// Another way of increasing network performance is to _pipeline_ operations with xref:batching-operations.adoc[Batching Operations].

// As well as various xref:concept-docs:data-model.adoc[Formats] of JSON, Couchbase can work directly with xref:non-json.adoc[arbitary bytes, or binary format].

Our xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[Query Engine] enables retrieval of information using the SQL-like syntax of N1QL.
