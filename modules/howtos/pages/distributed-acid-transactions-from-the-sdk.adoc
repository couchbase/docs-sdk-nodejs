== Requirements

* Couchbase Server 6.6.1 or above.
* Couchbase Node.js SDK 4.0.0 or above.
include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tag=requirements]


== Getting Started

Couchbase transactions require no additional components or services to be configured. 
Simply `npm install` the most recent version of the SDK.
You may, on occasion, need to import some enumerations for particular settings, but in basic cases nothing is needed.

== Configuration

Transactions can optionally be globally configured when configuring the `Cluster`.
For example, if you want to change the level of durability which must be attained, this can be configured as part of the connect options:

== Key-Value Mutations

=== Replacing

Replacing a document requires a `ctx.get()` call first.
This is necessary so the transaction can check that the document is not involved in another transaction.
If it is, then the transaction will handle this at the `ctx.replace()` point.
Generally, this involves rolling back what has been done so far, and retrying the lambda.
Handling errors should be done through try/catch as in the example above.

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=replace,indent=0]
----

=== Removing

As with replaces, removing a document requires a `ctx.get()` call first.

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=remove,indent=0]
----

=== Inserting

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=insert,indent=0]
----

== Key-Value Reads

From a transaction context you may get a document:

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=get,indent=0]
----

`get` will cause the transaction to fail with `TransactionFailedError` (after rolling back any changes, of course).
It is provided as a convenience method so the developer does not have to check the `Optional` if the document must exist for the transaction to succeed.

Gets will 'read your own writes', e.g. this will succeed:

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=getReadOwnWrites,indent=0]
----

include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tags=query-intro;!library-begin-transaction]

=== Using N1QL

If you already use N1QL from the Node.js SDK, then its use in transactions is very similar.
It returns the same `QueryResult` you are used to, and takes most of the same options.

You must take care to write `ctx.query()` inside the lambda however, rather than `cluster.query()` or `scope.query()`.

An example of selecting some rows from the `travel-sample` bucket:

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=queryExamplesSelect,indent=0]
----

Rather than specifying the full "`travel-sample`.inventory.hotel" name each time, it is easier to pass a reference to the inventory `Scope`:

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=queryExamplesSelectScope,indent=0]
----

An example using a `Scope` for an UPDATE:

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=queryExamplesUpdate,indent=0]
----

And an example combining SELECTs and UPDATEs.
It's possible to call regular Node.js functions from the lambda, as shown here, permitting complex logic to be performed.
Just remember that since the lambda may be called multiple times, so may the method.

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=queryExamplesComplex,indent=0]
----

=== Read Your Own Writes

As with Key-Value operations, N1QL queries support Read Your Own Writes.

This example shows inserting a document and then selecting it again.

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=queryInsert,indent=0]
----

<1> The inserted document is only staged at this point. as the transaction has not yet committed.
Other transactions, and other non-transactional actors, will not be able to see this staged insert yet.
<2> But the SELECT can, as we are reading a mutation staged inside the same transaction.

=== Mixing Key-Value and N1QL

Key-Value operations and queries can be freely intermixed, and will interact with each other as you would expect.

In this example we insert a document with Key-Value, and read it with a SELECT.

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=queryRyow,indent=0]
----

<1> As with the 'Read Your Own Writes' example, here the insert is only staged, and so it is not visible to other transactions or non-transactional actors.
<2> But the SELECT can view it, as the insert was in the same transaction.

=== Query Options

Query options can be provided via `TransactionQueryOptions`, which provides a subset of the options in the Node.js SDK's `QueryOptions`.

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=queryOptions,indent=0]
----

The supported options are:

* parameters 
* scanConsistency 
* clientContextId
* scanWait
* scanCap
* pipelineBatch
* pipelineCap
* profile
* readOnly
* adhoc
* raw

// Remove the API link below when we have the query options page available.

// TODO: Add the below when this is implemented for Node.js transactions.

// ----
//
// and configure it:
//
// [source,typescript]
// ----
// include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=querySingleConfigured,indent=0]
// ----

== Committing

Committing is automatic: if there is no explicit call to `ctx.commit()` at the end of the transaction logic callback, and no exception is thrown, it will be committed.
Committing is automatic at the end of the code block with the transaction context.
If no exception is thrown, it will be committed.
If you want to rollback the transaction, simply throw an exception.
Transactions may rollback from the transaction logic itself, various failure conditions, or from your application logic by throwing an exception.

As soon as the transaction is committed, all its changes will be atomically visible to reads from other transactions.
The changes will also be committed (or "unstaged") so they are visible to non-transactional actors, in an eventually consistent fashion.

Commit is final: after the transaction is committed, it cannot be rolled back, and no further operations are allowed on it.

An asynchronous cleanup process ensures that once the transaction reaches the commit point, it will be fully committed - even if the application crashes.


// == A Full Transaction Example

// include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=concurrency,indent=0]
// ----
//
// These events will be raised in the event of a non-transactional write being detected and overridden.
// The event contains the key of the document involved, to aid the application with debugging.


== Rollback

If an exception is thrown, either by the application from the lambda, or by the transaction internally, then that attempt is rolled back.
The transaction logic may or may not be retried, depending on the exception.
//- see link:#error-handling[Error handling and logging].

If the transaction is not retried then it will throw an exception, and its `error` contains details on the failure.
In Typescript, you may branch your error handling based on `instanceof` with one of `TransactionOperationFailedError`, `TransactionFailedError`, `TransactionExpiredError` or `TransactionCommitAmbiguousError`.

The application can use this to signal why it triggered a rollback, as so:

[source,typescript]
----
include::example$transactions-example.ts[tag=rollback-cause,indent=0]
----

After a transaction is rolled back, it cannot be committed, no further operations are allowed on it, and the system will not try to automatically commit it at the end of the code block.


//  Error Handling
include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tag=error]

There are three errors that Couchbase transactions can raise to the application: `TransactionFailedError`, `TransactionExpiredError` and `TransactionCommitAmbiguousError`.

// txnfailed
include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tag=txnfailed]

// TODO: Need an equivalent typescript snippet for the below
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=config-expiration,indent=0]
//----

include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tag=txnfailed1]

// TODO: Double check if this will be added in future.
// Doesn't seem to be available for the Node SDK.
//Similar to `TransactionResult`, `SingleQueryTransactionResult` also has an `unstagingComplete()` method.

=== Full Error Handling Example

Pulling all of the above together, this is the suggested best practice for error handling:

// Asynchronous Cleanup
include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tags=cleanup;!library-cleanup-buckets]

[#tuning-cleanup]
=== Configuring Cleanup

The cleanup settings can be configured as so:

[options="header"]
|===
|Setting|Default|Description
|`cleanupWindow`|60 seconds|This determines how long a cleanup 'run' is; that is, how frequently this client will check its subset of ATR documents.  It is perfectly valid for the application to change this setting, which is at a conservative default.  Decreasing this will cause expiration transactions to be found more swiftly (generally, within this cleanup window), with the tradeoff of increasing the number of reads per second used for the scanning process.
|`disableLostAttemptCleanup`|true|This is the thread that takes part in the distributed cleanup process described above, that cleans up expired transactions created by any client.  It is strongly recommended that it is left enabled.
|`disableClientAttemptCleanup`|true|This thread is for cleaning up transactions created just by this client.  The client will preferentially aim to send any transactions it creates to this thread, leaving transactions for the distributed cleanup process only when it is forced to (for example, on an application crash).  It is strongly recommended that it is left enabled.
|===

=== Monitoring Cleanup

To monitor cleanup, increase the verbosity on the logging.

//TODO: once events are available, re-add the below with relevant examples
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=cleanup-events,indent=0]
//----
//
//`TransactionCleanupEndRunEvent` is raised whenever a current 'run' is finished, and contains statistics from the run.
//(A run is typically around every 60 seconds, with default configuration.)
//
//A `TransactionCleanupAttempt` event is raised when an expired transaction was found by this process, and a cleanup attempt was made.
//It contains whether that attempt was successful, along with any logs relevant to the attempt.
//
//In addition, if cleanup fails to cleanup a transaction that is more than two hours past expiry, it will raise the `TransactionCleanupAttempt` event at WARN level (rather than the default DEBUG).
//With most default configurations of the event-bus (see <<Logging>> below), this will cause that event to be logged somewhere visible to the application.
//If there is not a good reason for the cleanup to be failed (such as a downed node that has not yet been failed-over), then the user is encouraged to report the issue.

== Logging

To aid troubleshooting, raise the log level on the SDK.
// TODO: need to add logging details to the error objects
//To aid troubleshooting, each transaction maintains a list of log entries, which can be logged on failure like this:

//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=logging,indent=0]
//----
//
//A failed transaction can involve dozens, even hundreds, of lines of logging, so the application may prefer to write failed transactions into a separate file.
//
//For convenience there is also a config option that will automatically write this programmatic log to the standard Couchbase Java logging configuration inherited from the SDK if a transaction fails.
//This will log all lines of any failed transactions, to `WARN` level:
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=config_warn,indent=0]
//----
//

Please see the xref:howtos:collecting-information-and-logging.adoc[Node.js SDK logging documentation] for details.

// TODO: re-add this once tracing becomes available
//== Tracing
//
//This telemetry is particularly useful for monitoring performance.
//
//If the underlying Couchbase Java SDK is configured for tracing, then no further work is required: transaction spans will be output automatically.
//See the xref:howtos:observability-tracing.adoc[Couchbase Java SDK Request Tracing documentation] for how to configure this.
//
//=== Parent Spans
//
//While the above is sufficient to use and output transaction spans, the application may wish to indicate that the transaction is part of a larger span -- for instance, a user request.
//It can do this by passing that as a parent span.
//
//If you have an existing OpenTelemetry span you can easily convert it to a Couchbase `RequestSpan` and pass it to the transactions library:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=tracing-wrapped,indent=0]
//----

== Concurrent Operations

The API allows operations to be performed concurrently inside a transaction, which can assist performance.
There are two rules the application needs to follow:

* The first mutation must be performed alone, in serial.
This is because the first mutation also triggers the creation of metadata for the transaction.
* All concurrent operations must be allowed to complete fully, so the transaction can track which operations need to be rolled back in the event of failure.
This means the application must 'swallow' the error, but record that an error occurred, and then at the end of the concurrent operations, if an error occurred, throw an error to cause the transaction to retry.

// TODO: update this for node
//These rules are demonstrated here:

//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=concurrentOps,indent=0]
//----


// TODO: re-enable once custom metadata collections are supported
// include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tag=custom-metadata-1]

//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=custom-metadata,indent=0]
//----

//include::{version-server}@sdk:shared:partial$acid-transactions.adoc[tag=custom-metadata-2]

// TODO: re-enable when deferred commits are supported
//== Deferred Commits
//
//NOTE: The deferred commit feature is currently in alpha, and the API may change.
//
//Deferred commits allow a transaction to be paused just before the commit point.
//Optionally, everything required to finish the transaction can then be bundled up into a context that may be serialized into a String or byte array, and deserialized elsewhere (for example, in another process).
//The transaction can then be committed, or rolled back.
//
//The intention behind this feature is to allow multiple transactions, potentially spanning multiple databases, to be brought to just before the commit point, and then all committed together.
//
//Here's an example of deferring the initial commit and serializing the transaction:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=defer1,indent=0]
//----
//
//And then committing the transaction later:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=defer2,indent=0]
//----
//
//Alternatively the transaction can be rolled back:
//
//[source,java]
//----
//include::example$TransactionsExample.java[tag=defer3,indent=0]
//----
//
//The transaction expiry timer (which is configurable) will begin ticking once the transaction starts, and is not paused while the transaction is in a deferred state.
