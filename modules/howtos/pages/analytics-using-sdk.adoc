{description}

For complex and long-running queries, involving large ad hoc join, set, aggregation, and grouping operations, Couchbase Data Platform offers the xref:6.5@server:analytics:introduction.adoc[Couchbase Analytics Service (CBAS)].
This is the analytic counterpart to our xref:n1ql-queries-with-sdk.adoc[operational data focussed Query Service].
The analytics service is available in Couchbase Data Platform 6.0 and later (developer preview in 5.5).


== Getting Started

After familiarizing yourself with our xref:6.5@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer],
in particular creating a dataset and linking it to a bucket to shadow the operational data, 
try Couchbase Analytics using the Node.js SDK.
Intentionally, the API for analytics is very similar to that of the query service.

== Queries

A query can either be `simple` or be `parameterized`. If parameters are used, they can either be `positional` or `named`. 
Here is one example of each:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/analytics.js[tag=simple-query]
----

The query may be performed with positional parameters:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/analytics.js[tag=posparam-query]
----

Alternatively, the query may be performed with named parameters:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/analytics.js[tag=namedparam-query]
----

NOTE: As timeouts are propagated to the server by the client, a timeout set on the client side may be used to stop the processing of a request, in order to save system resources.
See example in the next section.


== Fluent API

Additional parameters may be sent as part of the query, using the options block in the API.
There are currently three parameters:

* *Client Context ID*, sets a context ID that is returned back as part of the result.
Uses the `clientContextId` option; default is a random UUID 
* *Server Side Timeout*, customizes the timeout sent to the server. 
Does not usually have to be set, as the client sets it based on the timeout on the operation. 
Uses the `timeout` option, and defaults to the Analytics timeout set on the client (75s).
This can be adjusted at the xref:ref:client-settings.adoc#timeout-options[cluster global config level].
* *Priority*, set if the request should have priority over others.
The `priority` option, defaults to `false`.


Here, we give the request priority over others, and set a custom, server-side timeout value:

== Handling the Response


Assuming that no errors are thrown during the exceution of your query, the return value
will be a `AnalyticsQueryResult` object.  You can access the individual rows which were
returned through the rows property. 
These rows may contain various sorts of data and metadata, 
depending upon the nature of the query, 
as you will have seen when working through our xref:6.5@server:analytics:primer-beer.adoc[introductory primer].

include::../examples/analytics.js[tag=handle-rows]
----


=== MetaData

The `meta` property of `AnalyticsQueryResult` contains useful metadata, such as metrics, which contains
properties such as `elapsedTime`, and `resultCount`.
Here is a snippet printing out some metrics from a query:

[source,javascript,indent=0]
----
include::../examples/analytics.js[tag=handle-meta]
----

// For listing of available properties in the meta-data (and sub structures)
For a listing of available `metrics` in the meta-data, see the xref:concept-docs:analytics-for-sdk-users.adoc[Understanding Analytics] SDK doc.


== Scoped Queries on Named Collections

Given a dataset created against a collection, for example:

[source,n1ql]
----
CREATE DATASET `airports-collection` ON `travel-sample`.inventory.airport;
----

You can run a query as follows:

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/analytics.js[tag=handle-collection]
----
////
// The following is pending a query JSCBC-846
In addition to running a query via the `Cluster` object, you can run one via the `Scope` object.

[source,javascript]
----
include::../examples/analytics.js[tag=handle-scope]
----

== Advanced Analytics Topics

From Couchbase Data Platform 6.5, _Deferred Queries_ and _KV Ingestion_ are added to CBAS.
