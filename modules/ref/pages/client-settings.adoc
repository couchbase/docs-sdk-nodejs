WARNING: The backend implementation of client settings changed substantially in 4.0 and is not currently fully documented.
This will be resolved in a future 4.x release.
See xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc#sdk4-specifics[more details on migrating to 4.0].

Some details from the old `libcouchbase`
https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-c-client/group__lcb-cntl-settings.html[settings list] may be useful for reference.
