WARNING: The backend implementation of client settings changed substantially in 4.0 and is not currently fully documented.
This will be resolved in a future 4.x release.
See xref:project-docs:migrating-sdk-code-to-3.n.adoc#sdk4-specifics[more details on migrating to 4.0].

Some details from the old `libcouchbase`
https://docs.couchbase.com/sdk-api/couchbase-c-client/group__lcb-cntl-settings.html[settings list] may be useful for reference.

== Configuration Profiles

Configuration Profiles provide predefined client settings that allow you to quickly configure an environment for common use-cases.
When using a configuration profile, the current client settings are overridden with the values provided in the profile.
Any property that is not specified in the profile is left unchanged.

CAUTION: The Configuration Profiles feature is currently a xref:nodejs-sdk:project-docs:compatibility.adoc#interface-stability[Volatile API] and may be subject to change.

=== WAN Development

*Cluster Method:* `applyProfile("wanDevelopment")`

A `wanDevelopment` configuration profile can be used to modify client settings for development or high-latency environments.
This profile changes the default timeouts.
