=== Timeout Options Reference

Name: *Key-Value Timeout*::
Builder Method: `TimeoutConfig.kvTimeout(Duration)`
+
Default: `2.5s` -- _but see TIP, below_
+
System Property: `com.couchbase.env.timeout.kvTimeout`
+
The Key/Value default timeout is used on operations which are performed on a specific key if not overridden by a custom timeout.
This includes all commands like get(), getFromReplica() and all mutation commands, but does not include operations that are performed with enhanced durability requirements.
+
TIP: xref:concept-docs:durability-replication-failure-considerations.adoc#synchronous-writes[Durable Write operations] have their own timeout setting, `kvDurableTimeout`, see below.

Name: *Key-Value Durable Operation Timeout*::
Builder Method: `TimeoutConfig.kvDurableTimeout(Duration)`
+
Default: `10s`
+
System Property: `com.couchbase.env.timeout.kvDurableTimeout`
+
Key/Value operations with enhanced durability requirements may take longer to complete, so they have a separate default timeout.
+
WARNING: The `kvDurableTimeout` property is not part of the stable API and may change or be removed at any time.
